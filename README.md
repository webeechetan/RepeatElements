# RepeatElements.js

RepeatElements.js is a lightweight JavaScript library that enables the cloning of HTML elements a specified number of times using a `data-repeat` attribute.

## Features

- Easy to use: Just add a `data-repeat` attribute to your HTML elements.
- ID Management: Cloned elements with IDs get a unique suffix to maintain valid HTML.
- Recursive cloning: Nested elements with `data-repeat` are also cloned appropriately.

## Installation

Include RepeatElements.js in your project by adding the following script tag to your HTML:

```html
<script src="path_to_your_js_folder/RepeatElements.js"></script>
